Hi,
Well here is the source code to LUSerNet... I think its all there. This was my first big huge project so the files might be a little messed up, but overall the code is formated nicely and has some comments.

There are also some extra apps in there which I used for testing, and such, and also some code that I wrote but never used.

If you think something is missing please contact me....
If you want something explaining then you may also contact me, but I can't promise to answer your question.
