LUSerNet Buttons
----------------

Off button normally

On as you hover over the buttons

place them on grey background (see template)
selected buttons are red and stay red, so if
welcome was selected it would stay red and 
if you were to hover over the other buttons 
they would highlight (turn into the on version)
as you hover over.

also change cursor to the little hand when 
hovering the buttons

:)

any more questions goto me in channel or 
an email 


blah blah blah
